    <h3>RxJS examples</h3>
    For these examples, display the console
    <ol>
      <li><a target=_blank href=example1>Simple mouse click</a>
      Clicking anywhere on the screen causes a log message.
      <li><a target=_blank href=example2>Filtered mouse clicks</a>
      Clicking on the left side of the screen causes a log message
        with only the x and y coordinates.
      <li><a target=_blank href=example3>Merging mouse click
          streams</a>
        Clicking on either of the green cells genertes a log message.
      <li><a target=_blank href=example4>Adding some state to  mouse
          click streams</a>
        A mouse click in one of the squares will report the most
          recent red or green square that was clicked in.
        (This only works after you've clicked once in a red and a
          green square.)
      <li><a target=_blank href=example5>Adding more state</a>
        Now it simply logs how many times you've clicked.
    </ol>
    <h3>cycle.js examples</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><a target=_blank href=example6>Simple cycle.js example</a>
        Below the source code you'll
      see a select where you can change a color name and some text
      that echoes your choice.
      <li><a target=_blank href=example7>cycle.js example with two drivers</a>
        Like the previous example except the color gets saved into and
        loaded from local storage.
    </ol>
